# schoolbuddy
Web App (schoolbuddy) that schools, teachers and students can use to manage/edit/view information about the schools, teachers, classrooms, students, activities and tests.

Project created during the course "AngularJS Routing In-depth" on Pluralsight.

Description of the course:
Routing is a fundamental component of Angular applications. Taking full advantage of client-side routing in your Angular apps will lead to better structured code and a better experience for your users, since you will only have to update the portions of the web page that change as they interact with your app. This course will teach you how to implement routing in an Angular app with the most popular frameworks available. You will learn how to work with URLs, parameters, states, view hierarchies, and lots more.
